# Build a Ship Maintenance and Docking Gantt Chart

This project generates an interactive Gantt chart displaying the maintenance and docking periods of ships using Python and Plotly. The chart differentiates between maintenance and docking periods by color and displays the duration of each period on hover. This README explains the steps to set up, run the code, and any dependencies required.

## Dependencies
To run this code, you'll need:
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for data visualization

## Installation
To install pandas
- pip install pandas 

To install plotly
- pip install plotly

## Run the project
1. Clone the project to your working directory, or download the project directly. 
- git clone https://github.com/Tuannguyen2008/Build-a-Gantt-Chart.git

2. Check the Python File:
- Open the buildAGanttChart.py file in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook). This file likely contains the code that reads the data from GanttChartDataSet.xlsx, processes it, and generates a Gantt chart.

3. Run the Python Script:
- In your command line, navigate to the project directory and run the following command: python buildAGanttChart.py
- Alternatively, open the buildAGanttChart.py file in VS Code: Press F5 to start debugging (or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging).
